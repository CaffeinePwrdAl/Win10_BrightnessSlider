#### If you get error "Not Supported" 
#####  now there is ddc/ci , version1.02 gracefully fallback to ddc/ci mode  

1) paste this  windows powershell 
   
   $monitor = Get-WmiObject -ns root/wmi -class wmiMonitorBrightNessMethods$monitor.WmiSetBrightness(80,10) 
  
   if the code above gives error. then, there is nothing i can do . 
   because, WmiSetBrightness is provided by microsoft.  please dont open issue about this.
    
2) try install/update your graphic driver
